# v1.5.0 — Hyprland Canvas integration improvements

## Summary

First public release of the `shinishiz/hyprland-canvas` fork.

Based on [zyrophix/hyprland-canvas](https://github.com/zyrophix/hyprland-canvas) at commit `0b81a9a`.

Tested with:
- Hyprland 0.56.2
- Fedora Linux 44 (Workstation Edition)
- Python 3.12 / uv 0.12.9

## New features (vs upstream v1.4.0)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Auto-float on openwindow | New tiled windows opened while Canvas is active automatically become floating and join the Canvas |
| Socket2 event listener | Listens to Hyprland's `.socket2.sock` for `openwindow`/`closewindow` events |
| Sensible spawn geometry | New windows use median geometry from original tiled snapshot |
| Canvas state persistence | State persisted in `toggle-state.json` + local cache |
| Spawned window tracking | Windows spawned during Canvas ON are tracked and restored on OFF |
| Hyprland 0.56.2 compatibility | Updated for API changes in 0.56.2 |
| Safer address normalization | Robust window address handling between socket2 events and j/clients |
| Workspace-scoped Canvas state | Per-workspace Canvas state tracking |
